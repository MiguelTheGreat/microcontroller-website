                                <li>AURIX is Infineon's high-performance automotive MCU family built around the proprietary TriCore architecture (32-bit CPU combining RISC, DSP, and microcontroller capabilities). Designed for safety-critical automotive applications, it supports ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance with features like lockstep cores, ECC-protected memories, and hardware safety monitors. Widely deployed in engine management, electric vehicle inverters, braking systems, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), AURIX delivers deterministic real-time performance essential for automotive electrification and autonomous driving.</li>

                                <li>XMC is Infineon's scalable family of ARM Cortex-M based MCUs (M0, M4, and M7 cores) optimized for industrial applications requiring precise real-time control. Key strengths include specialized peripherals for motor control (POSIF, CCU8), power conversion (high-resolution PWMs), and industrial connectivity (CAN, EtherCAT). Popular in factory automation, solar inverters, robotics, and power supplies, XMC devices balance performance, integration, and cost-effectiveness while leveraging Infineon's power semiconductor expertise for seamless system design.</li>

                                <li>Originally developed by Cypress Semiconductor (acquired by Infineon in 2020), PSoC integrates an ARM Cortex-M core with programmable analog and digital fabric on a single chip. This unique architecture allows designers to customize peripheral functions, such as op-amps, ADCs, timers, or communication interfaces, via reconfigurable hardware blocks rather than fixed silicon. Ideal for IoT edge devices, wearables, and consumer electronics, PSoC accelerates development by reducing external component count and enabling rapid prototyping of mixed-signal applications with minimal PCB complexity.</li>
